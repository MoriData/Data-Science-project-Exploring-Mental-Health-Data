# Exploring Mental Health Data üß†

This repository contains my work on analyzing and modeling mental health data, inspired by the Kaggle notebook [Exploring Mental Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/moridata/exploring-mental-health-data-score-0-94163). This project aims to identify trends, perform data analysis, and build predictive models to gain insights into mental health in various contexts.

## Project Overview üìä

Mental health is a critical issue impacting people across all demographics and regions. In this project, I explore a dataset related to mental health, performing in-depth data analysis and predictive modeling to achieve a score of 0.94163. This analysis aims to uncover patterns in the data and provide a basis for further study or intervention planning.

**Key Objectives:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, trends, and patterns in the data.
- Apply preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for modeling.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict mental health-related outcomes.
- Achieve high model accuracy while ensuring interpretability and meaningful insights.

## Dataset üìö

The data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition [Mental Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The dataset includes various features related to demographics, personal history, and workplace factors that may influence mental health.

> **Note:** Due to Kaggle's terms of use, the dataset is not included in this repository. Please download the data from the Kaggle competition page linked above.
